# Yoga Class Admission Form

Welcome to the Yoga Class Admission Form! This application allows users to enroll in our monthly yoga classes by filling out a simple form.

## Live Deployment
Visit our live deployment: [Yoga Class Admission Form](https://yogaform.vercel.app/)



## Usage
1. *Fill out the Form*: Input your details in the form fields.
2. *Batch Selection*: Choose your preferred batch timing from the options provided.
3. *Payment*: Payment of 500 INR is required every month.
4. *Submission*: Accept the terms of service and submit the form.

## Features:

- User registration with age validation (18-65)
- ‚è∞ Selection of preferred batch timing (6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM, 5-6PM)
- Simulated payment integration (through mock function)
- Real-time user data and payment status updates
- Deployed on Vercel
## Technologies:

-  ‚öõ Frontend: React and Create React App
-  ‚ö° Backend: Node.js and Express
Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Heroku)
## Problem Solving:

### This project tackled various challenges:

1.Designing a user-friendly and efficient data capture form in React.

2. Building a REST API on Node.js to handle user data, validation, and simulated payment integration.
  
3. implementing a PostgreSQL database schema to store user information, batch preferences, and payment status.
 
4. Deploying the application on Vercel for accessibility and scalability.
 
## Database Design (ER Diagram and SQLs):

The ER diagram consists of three tables:

### Users:

id (primary key)
name
email (unique)
age (INT NOT NULL CHECK(age BETWEEN 18 AND 65))
contact
### Batches:

id (primary key)
timing (unique)
### Enrollments:

id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key to Users)
batch_id (foreign key to Batches)
payment_status (enum: Pending, Success, Failed)
payment_date
## Sample SQLs:
```
SQL
CREATE TABLE Users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  age INT NOT NULL CHECK(age BETWEEN 18 AND 65),
  contact VARCHAR(20),
  ...
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE Batches (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  timing VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  ...
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES Users(id),
  batch_id INTEGER REFERENCES Batches(id),
  payment_status ENUM('PENDING', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED'),
  payment_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT active_enrollment UNIQUE (user_id, active)
);
```

## Code Architecture:

### Front-End:
Form component for user data input
Batch selection component with availability check
API communication handler for data submission
Mock payment integration function
### Back-End:
API routes for data validation and processing
Database interaction with PostgreSQL hosted on Heroku
Mock payment function integration
## Deployment:

The application is deployed on Vercel, accessible at https://yogaform.vercel.app/
